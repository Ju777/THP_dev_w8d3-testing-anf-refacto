# Gilded Rose Kata : refactoring and testing
This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub here. See also Bobby Johnson's description of the kata.

Whichever testing approach you choose, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.
